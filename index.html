        <p><i>Cool facts about Ciciadas</i></p>
        <ul>
            <li>The cicadas are a superfamily, the Cicadoidea, of insects in the order Hemiptera . They are in the suborder Auchenorrhyncha, along with smaller jumping bugs such as leafhoppers and froghoppers.</li>
            <li>Cicadas have prominent eyes set wide apart, short antennae, and membranous front wings.</li>
            <li>The annual cicadas are species that emerge every year. Though these cicadas have lifecycles that can vary from one to nine or more years as underground larvae, their emergence above ground as adults is not synchronized, so some members of each species appear every year.</li>
